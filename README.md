YOLOv5 Object Detection in Noisy Images
* Brief instruction using Google Colaborator
 * original link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0DO1C8uYP8
 * can use free provided GPU (Runtime - Change runtime type - GPU)
 * make a new folder and name it as dataset and upload dataset
 * change directory to content by typing %cd /content/
 * clone YOLOv5 by !git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.git
 * install requirements
  * %cd /content/yolov5/
  * !pip install -r requirements.txt
 * split dataset to train and validation (only if dataset isn't splitted into two)
  * %cd /
  * from glob import glob
  * img_list = glob('/content/dataset/(location of images)/*.jpg')
  * from sklearn.model_selecion import train_test_split
  * train, val = train_test_split(img_list, test_size=0.2, random_state=2000)
